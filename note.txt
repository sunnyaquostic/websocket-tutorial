websocket keeps open connection using protocol instead of http.

Websocket is used for real-time communication between client and server and is better than polling and long polling because in polling long header 
is used and it is not efficient.

WEBSOCKET LIFE CYCLE:
1. Connection establishment:
    - Client sends a handshake request to the server.
2. Upgrading to websocket:
    - Server sends a handshake response to the client.
    - Connection is upgraded to websocket.
3. Stateful communication:
    - Client and server can send and receive data at any time.
4. Ping-pong:
    - Client sends a ping to the server.
    - Server sends a pong to the client.
5. Opcode:
    - 0x0: Continuation frame
    - 0x1: Text frame
    - 0x2: Binary frame
    - 0x3: Close frame
    - 0x4: Ping frame
    - 0x5: Pong frame
6. Frame:
    - Frame is the unit of data in websocket.
    - Frame is sent and received in binary format.
    - Frame is sent and received in frames.

7.Backpressure:
    - Backpressure is the mechanism to control the flow of data from server to client.
    - Backpressure is used to avoid buffer overflow.
    - Backpressure is used to avoid data loss.
    - Backpressure is used to avoid latency.
    - Backpressure is used to avoid congestion.
    - Backpressure is used to avoid jitter.
    - Backpressure is used to avoid packet loss.
    - Backpressure is used to avoid packet corruption.
    - Backpressure is used to avoid packet duplication.
    - Backpressure is used to avoid packet reordering.
    - Backpressure is used to avoid packet corruption.
    - Backpressure is used to avoid packet duplication.
    - Backpressure is used to avoid packet reordering.
    - Backpressure is used to avoid packet corruption.
    - Backpressure is used to avoid packet duplication.
    - Backpressure is used to avoid packet reordering.


1. connection establishment:
2. opening handshake:
3. closing handshake:
4. closed:

MESSAGE ENVELOP
this can be either:
    type-based commands - this is the best
    topic-based messages - when channel are dynamic


MESSAGE STRUCTURE :- Data canbe in JSON(join, auth, commands) and BINARY(Movement, audio, sensors)
MESSAGE ROUTING :- Broadcast(one to all), Unicast(one to one) and Multicast (one to many)
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT :- send message to server with an id and server returns receipt with the same id, if you dont get the receipt then retry to send the msg again
PUB/SUB PATTERN :- YOU recieve only what you care about

WEB RTC (vOICE, VIDEO AND P2P)
this allow two browser to talk to each other directly without latency.
